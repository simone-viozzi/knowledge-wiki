# Get the most common email domains

In this Bite you will process a list of emails determining what are the most common domain names.

You only want to look at owned domain names, so you will exclude the most popular (free) providers like gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc.

To accomplish this you will first complete get_common_domains scraping a list of 100 most popular email domains (cached here in case that website changes).

Then you will complete get_most_common_domains, using the common domain exclusion list.

Recommended modules are already imported for you. Happy coding!
